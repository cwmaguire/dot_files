dot_files
=========

My bash, vim and potentially other dot files

This is mainly so I can clean out the cruft without losing any history.
I'm going through "Learn Vimscript the Hard Way" so this may be updated,
but maybe not.

The vim stuff requires that Janus is installed:
curl -L https://bit.ly/janus-bootstrap | bash
(which requires curl to be installed in Ubuntu, currently)
